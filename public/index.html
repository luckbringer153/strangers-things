<!-- Page Flow:
1. fetch initial data and build application site
2. buildinitial interface from application site
3. set up all event listeners for interface (these event listeners might transform interaction into API requests)
4. user interaction triggers event listeners, which in turn update data in multiple places (pass update requests to API / API returns success or failure for update / on success update state to reflect change / on failure render useful error message to user)
5. react re-renders components based on updated state -->
